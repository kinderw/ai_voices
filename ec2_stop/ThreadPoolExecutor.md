ThreadPoolExecutor is a class from the concurrent.futures module in Python that allows you to easily parallelize the execution of a function. It works by creating a pool of worker threads that can be used to execute the function.

When you create an instance of ThreadPoolExecutor, you can specify the maximum number of worker threads in the pool. By default, it will use as many worker threads as there are CPU cores on the machine. Each worker thread can then be used to execute a function concurrently.

In this case, when the stop_old_instances function is called, it creates an instance of ThreadPoolExecutor using the with statement. This creates a pool of worker threads that can be used to execute the stop_instance function concurrently.

The futures list is used to keep track of the Future objects returned by the executor.submit() method. Each Future object represents the result of a function execution, and you can use the result() method to retrieve the result of the function call.

It loops through the instances in the CSV file and for each instance it creates a session with the appropriate profile and submits the stop_instance function to the thread pool with the specific session, instance_id, and region.

Then it loops through the futures, calling future.result() which blocks until the function call completes and returns the result, thus it waits for the completion of all instances to be stopped before it exits.

By using the ThreadPoolExecutor, it allows the script to work on multiple instances simultaneously, reducing the total time it takes to stop all instances.
